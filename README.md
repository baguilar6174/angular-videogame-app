# Angular Video Games App

This project presents an application to display and filter video games. This project was generated with [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

## Description

This project uses Rapidapi services and the largest RAWG video game database to obtain video games, show their details, screenshots, trailers, platforms, descriptions and official websites.

## Installation

To use this project, I recommend creating and using your own credentials in case the repository's are expired.

To generate your credentials you can visit [Rapiapi](https://rapidapi.com "Rapiapi") and [RAGW](https://rawg.io/ "RAGW"). Create your account and get your keys. Replace these values in the `app/core/interceptors/headers.interceptor.ts` file.
Run `npm i` and `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
